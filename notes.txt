Lots of corner cases.

Example 1:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Title: 20 M 176 5’10”
Body Fat: empty
Age: empty
Sex: M
Height: 5’10”
Weight: empty
['20', 'M', '176', '5’10”']

Here we could assume that 20 is age, and 176 is weight. 
1. Maybe we can assume that any title token with no unit and under 50 is age.
2. Maybe we can assume that any title token with no unit, over 50 and under 300 is weight is pounds.

(1) I believe might be okay, but (2) is problematic, since it could also be kilos.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Title: 6ft1 170lb - 210lb (lockdown did a number😂)
Body Fat: empty
Age: empty
Sex: empty
Height: 6ft1
Weight: 210lb
['6ft1', '170lb', '-', '210lb', '(lockdown', 'did', 'a', 'number😂)']

This is probably just a gallery, which would explain the weight range.
Sounds like a future me problem.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Title: 35f 5’11 145-150
Body Fat: empty
Age: empty
Sex: empty
Height: 5’11
Weight: empty
['35f', '5’11', '145-150']

Probably a galery again, also age and sex are also given, and I believe
that this is a common format ( INT<F,M> )

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Title: estimates? 6’5 248 22, 18 weeks out
Body Fat: empty
Age: empty
Sex: empty
Height: 6’5
Weight: empty
['estimates?', '6’5', '248', '22,', '18', 'weeks', 'out']

The weight assumption previously mentioned would work here as well.
